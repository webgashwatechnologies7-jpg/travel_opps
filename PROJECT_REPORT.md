## 1. Executive Summary

This project is a sophisticated **Travel CRM (Customer Relationship Management)** system designed to help travel agencies manage their entire workflow from a single platform. It follows a **SaaS (Software as a Service)** model where multiple companies (tenants) can subscribe and use the platform to manage their leads, create itineraries, handle operations, and track finances.

The system is built using a modern technology stack:
- **Backend:** Laravel (PHP) - Handles business logic, database, and APIs.
- **Frontend:** React.js - Provides a dynamic, responsive user interface.
- **Database:** MySQL - Stores all permanent records.

## 2. System Architecture & Data Flow

The system employs a **Hybrid Data Approach** to balance performance and reliability.

### 2.1 Data Storage Strategy
| Data Category | Storage Location | Reasoning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Sessions** | Session Storage | Ensures security; clears when browser closes. |
| **Lead / Client Data** | Database (MySQL) | Permanent records required for CRM and history. |
| **Itinerary Drafts** | **Local Storage** | Allows fast, offline-capable drafting without server lag. |
| **Confirmed Bookings** | Database (MySQL) | Financial and operational integrity. |
| **Master Data** | Database (MySQL) | Shared resources like Hotels, Flights, Activities. |

### 2.2 Application Flow
1.  **Authentication:** User logs in via API; Token stored in Session.
2.  **Lead Capture:** Leads enter via manual entry, website forms, or imports.
3.  **Itinerary Building:**
    *   User selects destination and dates.
    *   Adds flights, hotels, activities day-by-day.
    *   *Note:* This process uses **Local Storage** heavily to prevent data loss during drafting and ensure speed.
4.  **Proposal & Quotation:** System generates a PDF/Link for the client.
5.  **Confirmation:** Client accepts -> Data moves from Draft (Local Storage) to Database (Permanent).
6.  **Operations:** Vouchers and Invoices are generated.
